👋 Hi, I’m Hang Le, in Hanoi, Vietnam

👩 I have six years working as a Forex Trader before running a fashion store for four years. My store had closed due to Covid-19. 
👀 As my interest in statistics and analyzing data for further insights, I’m interested in making a transition to Data Career

🤞 I have finished:
 3-month Data Analyst course at hocdataonline.com (Aug 2021) 
DA-100: Analyzing Data with Power BI course at Datapot.com (Oct 2021)
Several Udemy courses cover basic SQL, Python skills

🌱 I’m currently: 
Preparing to take DA-100 certificate
Continuing to finish Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate at Coursera
Practicing SQL skills on HackerRank
Practicing Python skills by building some projects using Python library to explore and explain data

💞️ I’m looking to find a new Data Analyst position
It might be a little late to become a Data fresher at my age, but I am extremely hardworking and constantly learning to improve my abilities.
