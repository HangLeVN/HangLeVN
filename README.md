👋 Hi, I’m Hang Le, in Hanoi, Vietnam

👩 I have six years working as a Forex Trader before running a fashion store for four years. Unfortunately, my store had closed due to Covid-19. 

👀 As my interest in working with numbers and solving issues using an analytical approach, I have made up my mind about pursuing a career in data field. I fully understand it would be such a long road but I dare to step day by day.

🤞 I have finished:
- 3-month Data Analyst course at hocdataonline.com (Aug 2021) 
- DA-100: Analyzing Data with Power BI course at [Datapot.com](https://home.datapot.vn/product/powerbi-and-analytical-thinking/) (Oct 2021)
- Several Udemy courses cover [basic SQL](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-a23a9721-bcb7-4da7-b313-c8ec4044afdb/), Python skills

🌱 I’m currently: 
- Preparing to take DA-100 certificate - Passed on November 09,2021
- Continuing to finish Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate at Coursera
- Practicing SQL skills on HackerRank
- Practicing Python skills by building some projects using Python library to explore and explain data

💞️ I’m looking to find a new Data Analyst position
It might be a little late to become a Data fresher at my age, but I am extremely hardworking and constantly learning to improve my abilities.
